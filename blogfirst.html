        <br>
        HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. You can view then using any web browser (such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox). The browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.
        Usually, the average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance: home pages, about pages, contact pages would all have separate HTML document.        
        Below, you can see a code example of how HTML elements can be structured.</p>
